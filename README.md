# Skipper
OS for a robot named "Skipper" - Mobile LiDAR Communication Robot <br>
By: Samuel Barr & Eli McGalliard

## Design and Sensors
This robot was built to be lightweight and smaller than most with numberous sensors to help it figure out its enviornment.
Sensors include:
 - Six  (6) line tracking sensors
 - One (1) Ultrasonic sensor
 - Two (2) Optical Shaft Encoders
 - One (1) LiDAR (Laser Imaging, Detection And Ranging) Device
 
## Goals
This robot also includes one (1) UART Wireless Transmitter and with that we plan to have the robot study it's surroundings
and transmit that data to our other robot (Bartholemew).
